Seven Concurrency Models In Seven Weeks

1. Thread
- Race Condition : the behavior of an electronic, software or other system where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other uncontrollable events. It becomes a bug when events do not happen in the order the programmer intended. The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other to influence the output first.
- Memore Visibility : 한 Thread에서 변경한 특정 메모리의 값이, 다른 Thread에서 제대로 읽어지는지
- Deadlock : In concurrent computing, a deadlock occurs when two competing actions wait for the other to finish, and thus neither ever does.
